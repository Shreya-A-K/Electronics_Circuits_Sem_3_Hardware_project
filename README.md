<h1> Potentiometer-Controlled Differential Amplifier Comparator Project </h1>

This project demonstrates the working of a BJT-based differential amplifier as a DC voltage comparator.
Two potentiometers are used to create adjustable voltage dividers, providing independent input signals to the bases of the two transistors.

By adjusting the potentiometer values, you can vary the base voltages.

The transistor receiving the higher base voltage conducts more current, turning its LED ON.

The other transistor remains OFF (or dim), showing the comparator action.

This makes it easy to visualize how a differential amplifier compares two DC input signals without requiring oscilloscopes or complex equipment.
